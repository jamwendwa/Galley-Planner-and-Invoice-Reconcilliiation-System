PROJECT TITLE
GALLEY PLANNER AND INVOICE RECONCILIATION SYSTEM






Abstract
In-flight catering management entails numerous challenges. It’s more than just reducing meal wastage and managing costs. It’s also getting the right service on the right flight, every time. It is managing volumes of information from numerous, disparate sources. It’s coordinating across internal departments, caterers and service providers around the globe. Finally, it’s optimizing every piece of the equation, from use of airline-owned assets, to effectively handling daily operational changes, to ensuring that invoices match the services provided.
The proposed system is expected to meet all the above requirements and will streamline all the activities in the catering department.

1.0	Introduction
The proposed system is called a Galley Planner and Invoice Reconciliation System. It will be handling all the catering operations of a flight company. The system will be able to define aircraft types. Different aircrafts have different designs in size, shape and even class. The system will define each aircraft through these properties.

The aircrafts have different types of galleys. A galley is the kitchen compartment in a flight. Each galley has a galley loading manual. The system is supposed to automatically load this manual for each aircraft. It’s through this manual that the system will define the kind of meals that are supposed to be loaded to the aircraft. The system will be able to automatically generate, upload and download the galley loading manual. In case the standards of the set manual are not met, the system will be able to generate alerts.

Every flight and route has a different type of a menu depending on factors such as the length of the flight. The system will be able to define the menus for each flight and generate different menus at different times and routes.

The proposed system will also provide suppliers with a login screen where they will be able to interact with the flight company. They will be able to issue invoices through the system and all activities will be conducted through the system. The system will also work on the invoices and any requests made by either the suppliers or the caterers. 





2.0 Problem Definition
•	The catering section is charged with providing world class in-flight cuisine to customers aboard the company’s flights. 

•	Different scheduled flights require different types of catering equipment to be loaded dependent upon the type of aircraft, the length of the flight, the final destination, the scheduled stops and the predominant nationality of the passengers.

•	This process is currently manually done in Excel and is very time consuming. A change to galley specifications necessitates the updating of several documents. As the airline expands, this will get increasingly harder to do. 

•	We do not at present have a document that details the weights of every catering item uplifted. This has an impact on aircraft weight management.

•	In addition to this, the catering section receives 3000+ invoices from NBO station alone for reconciliation. These are reconciled manually and it’s an extremely laborious and time consuming activity 






3.0 Objectives
Some of the specific objectives include:
•	A galley planner that manages catering product on all aircraft in the flight company.
•	Invoice reconciliation that automates the entire invoicing process.
•	Change once; update much functionality for the Galley application.
•	Master data repository for Catering operations
•	Pricing information for all services provided across flight company’s network that touches on Catering services
The main objectives include:
•	Develop and deploy a robust Galley Planner and Invoice reconciliation application to run catering operations efficiently that would include:
o	A module to be used for creating the aircraft, galley and tray layouts and linking them to the database.
	Each aircraft type requires a diagram of the aircraft itself showing where all the galleys and if required, the seating and toilet positions are.
	The module will also include the galley elevations showing the physical layout of where the catering stowage locations are.
	Each stowage bay has a space capacity measured in cu feet, cu meters or cu centimeters that cannot physically be exceeded together with a loading capacity in kilograms or pounds that the user is warned if he exceeds. These values must be defined for each stowage bay. 
	Also each stowage location has only certain types of items or containers that are allowed to be stowed and these rules can be defined by the planner.
•	The software to be developed should be  designed to speed up the process of stowage planning of catering equipment for these diverse routes
•	The application should allow the catering planner to import or enter directly all the codes and descriptions of the equipment procured by the catering supply chain, and import or enter the information about all the scheduled flights. 
•	The application should capture all pertinent information including the start and finish locations, the stop off stations, the aircraft type and the distribution and numbers of seats of each class. This information can then be used to commence the stowage planning process















4.0 Project Justification
The goal of this project is:
1.	Have all catering information centralized in one application for use in catering operations. The catering operations will all be handled by the system. For example, the suppliers and the catering staff will communicate through the system. This will eradicate the time wasted making calls and sending people to the office for the catering processes.  
2.	Reduce invoice reconciliation from 3 weeks of manual work to 1 day or less of automated and distributed processing. The invoicing of all the supplied products will be done through the system once a product has been supplied to the flight company. The system will process the invoice and check for errors in accordance to the products supplied, reducing time and increasing efficiency.
3.	Reduce the time used to contest variances and thus close each month on time as well as proactively manage catering budgets.
4.	Aircraft types are manually written in a hard copy. When an aircraft gets to the airport, the catering department has to manually check for these descriptions. Once the system is developed, it will automatically describe each aircraft and their designs enabling quick loading of their galleys. The system will make this efficient, eradicates errors and reduce time wasted.
5.	The catering department in the departure area usually has to communicate to their colleagues in the destination to explain to them the kind of meals that have been loaded in the aircraft so that they prepare for offloading and cleaning. With this system, they will be required to log in to it and will get all the details on the galley in the aircraft, hence reducing the expenses used in making calls, as well as time.
6.	The system will allow the vendors to make invoices and sent them to the flight company for payment. Normally, the vendors have to sent someone to the catering office for the processing of the invoice. Sometimes the invoices might have errors prompting a lot of movement to and from the office. However, this system will be able to solve all these as well as providing a module for checking whether an invoice has an error or not.






5.0 General Scope and Application of the project
This is a solution to the problem that Kenya Airways face in their catering unit. The manual system that they use cost them a lot in terms of time and number of employees they use in the department. However, this system will significantly reduce time and cost of the manual system.
Most African flights use a manual system in their catering departments. It is only in Europe and UAE where there are a significant number of flights using an automated system. This system will therefore serve as a long lasting solution to most of the African flights and other flights all over the world. It has various benefits among them:

Increase efficiency Automates manual processes, interfaces with disparate systems, streamlines workflows and coordinates interdepartmentally through a centralized toolset for airline, caterer and supplier users worldwide.

Reduce in-flight service expense Provides savings through reduced meal wastage, optimized back catering, decreased inventory levels and robust financial controls. In-flight business intelligence tools provide visibility into financial and operational data.

Streamline operations Centralizes communication of service changes and automates service adjustments resulting from operational changes.

Lower IT costs Eliminates upfront capital costs. 




6.0 Literature Review
6.1 The flight catering system
Anon. (1998) “Caterer Profile: Dobbs International Services,” IFCA/IFSA Review,
1 (1) January, 18–23.



















Flight catering is probably one of the most complex operational systems in the world. For instance, a large-scale flight catering production unit may employ over 800 staff to produce as many as 25,000 meals per day during peak periods. A large international airline company may have hundreds of takeoffs and landings every day from just their main hub. These facts and others like them make flight catering unlike any other sector of the catering industry. While the way food is served on trays to airline passengers bears some resemblance to service styles in restaurants or cafeterias, the way food is prepared and cooked increasingly resembles a food manufacturing plant rather than a catering kitchen. The way food and equipment is stored resembles a freight warehouse, and the way meals and equipment are transported and supplied has a close affinity to military-style logistics and distribution systems. 

Flight catering starts with an understanding of the number of passengers and their needs with such information available from both market research and actual passenger behavior. On the basis of this, airlines, sometimes in consultation with caterers and suppliers, develop their product and service specifications. Such specifications determine exactly what food, drink and equipment items are to be carried on each route for each class of passenger. At the heart of the flight catering system is the flight production unit, which is part warehouse, part food manufacturing plant, part kitchen, and part assembly belt. In response to forecasts of passenger numbers on any given flight, the production unit follows a series of complex steps to produce trayed meals and non-food items ready for transportation to the aircraft. O’Hara, L. and Strugnell, C. (1997) “Developments in In-flight Catering,” Nutrition and Food Science, vol. 3, 105–106.

Transportation is usually carried out by using specialist high-loader trucks that enable trolleys to be rolled on and off aircraft. Once loaded, trolleys and other items need to be stowed on board to ensure the microbial safety of edible items and the security and safety of the crew, passengers, and aircraft. At the designated time during the flight, the cabin crew then carries out the service of meals, snacks, and other items. On arrival at its destination, each aircraft is then stripped of all the equipment and trolleys, which are returned to the production units for cleaning and re-use.	
6.2 Major Stakeholders
Tabacchi, M. and Marshall, R.C. (1988) “Consumer Perceptions of In-flight
Food Service,” The Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, vol.
28, no. 4, 20–23.
The in-flight catering industry consists of five major players: the airlines, or their various representatives; the providers, in this case specialized flight caterers; the suppliers, either to the providers or direct to the airlines; those using the airline's services that are the fare-paying passengers and distributors. The diagram below shows their relationships.








  			














6.3 Reconfiguring the Flight Catering Supply Chain
In addition to the three ‘traditional’ models of the flight catering supply chain four new models have been developed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. One of the first examples of forward integration was in the 1990s when Delta Daily Food, a supplier, forwardly integrated and took over elements of the supply chain normally carried out by the caterer. This was made possible by the proximity of their food factory to Schipol airport in Amsterdam, so that it was possible for them to add packaging, tray and trolley assembly to their existing food manufacturing facility. However, this model is relatively unusual, as it does depend on the supplier being located relatively close to airports.

Another way for suppliers to forwardly integrate is to eliminate some elements of the supply chain so that they can supply airports from wherever their factories are located. This typically involves using disposable packaging that eliminates the need for tray assembly and even trolley assembly. For instance, Supplair have developed a range of retail style food products and disposable packaging that can be delivered direct to flight kitchens, so that the role of the caterer is reduced to tray and trolley assembly and loading.

A slightly different example of this approach is the Nestle Sky Tray. This concept consists of the ‘Hot Pocket’ brand, a hand held hot snack, which is packaged on a thermally resistance service tray. The trays are packaged in boxes that are the same size as aircraft ovens. Hence boxes can be transported by Nestle to flight kitchens and then loaded directly onto aircraft without any assembly by the caterer. On the aircraft, the trays are unloaded from their container, placed in the oven, reheated and then used to serve the passengers directly from the oven. Not only does the concept eliminate elements of the caterer’s part of the supply chain, it also simplifies the airlines design of meals, requiring them only to select the product they want.

As well suppliers forwardly integrating, caterers are also able to do this. This means that airlines focus solely on setting the overall service strategy and outsource the specific design of items, components, galley planning and sourcing to the caterer. Airlines have been encourages to do this by the development of internet based systems such as e-gate matrix and e-LSG, which can allow both the caterer and the airline to see what is happening at each stage of the supply chain. Alpha Flight Catering have set up a division called In-Flight Service Management (IFSM) which also takes over many of the activities that the airlines in-flight department may previously have carried out. They argue that IFSM, because it manages many airlines, can afford to employ experts in a wide range of areas that individual, smaller, airlines would not be able to employ; and that such expertise leads to lower cost operations.

Finally, a new stakeholder has entered the supply chain in the form of third party logistics providers, such as Kuehne and Nagel. These logistics companies tend to have a global warehousing and transportation capability that enables them to achieve significant economies of scale. This enables them to take over those elements of the supply chain in relation to storage and transportation at a lower cost than can be achieved by any one of the existing stakeholders. In particular, logistics have been successful with respect to the traditional retail supply chain. In fact, these four are simply examples of how different elements of the supply chain are being bundled together in new and original ways. In line with many other industries, it is becoming clear that the concept of the supply chain is somewhat old fashioned.

It is more appropriate to think in terms of a supply network, with all the increased sophistication that a network configuration would suggest. Hence it is possible for a single airline to have adopted a number of different configurations depending on where it flies to, its type of route and so forth. In addition, this analysis shows that only a few elements of the supply network are always undertaken by the same stakeholder. Airlines are always responsible for their strategy, but may outsource every other element. Likewise caterers are always responsible for loading and unloading aircraft, recycling and waste disposal because no other stakeholder has the infrastructure, i.e. the high-loader fleet necessary to perform these tasks. Outside of these areas, it increasingly becoming blurred as to whether or not it is the caterers, the suppliers or third party distributors engaged in the different elements of the supply network.

Increasingly, supply chain management is linked closely to inventory management, as operations try to reduce their stock-holdings and rely on just-in-time (JIT) delivery and production. This has cash flow benefits for the business, as well as potentially reducing the capital investment costs in storage facilities. But even with JIT, flight caterers are still required to ensure safe and secure storage of all types of materials in their production units.

In summary, there are five major types of players in the airline catering business. These are the carriers (Airlines), the providers (Caterers), the suppliers (manufacturers), the distributors and the passengers. Each airline carrier decides what kind and how much food service they require and which flights need which types of service. Obviously food service can be used as a marketing tool; some airlines for instance, do not give as much service if they have no competition or if the flight is exceptionally short such as under 1 hour. Some passengers may be willing to forgo food on 'no frills' or 'peanuts' flights if fare prices are slashed. All of this is for the airline company to decide. The carrier must also decide whether to operate its own catering operation or which caterer to contract with. This decision is based upon location, availability, reliability, long time relationships, cost and convenience. Costs must be carefully negotiated by both the caterer and the carrier. The carrier cannot afford to pay too much as each fraction of a penny may add up to thousands of pounds or dollars, while the caterer cannot afford to accept too little as food prices may fluctuate or labor costs may increase, and the caterer must deliver a quality product to preserve not only their image but that of the airline.

Manufacturers/suppliers who prepare food for the airlines also take advantage of economies of scale to purchase raw goods for the manufacture of airline meals, desserts, beverages and snacks. These suppliers can produce meals for economy class much more cheaply and efficiently than can most flight kitchens, hence catering companies tend to buy these meals from vendor/suppliers. Distributors play dual roles for airlines and caterers. They obviously distribute materials and meals from vendor/suppliers and they can track numbers, volumes, brands and hence quality of food for the airlines. The airlines want value for their money. One of the ways in which they ascertain value is through establishing with the caterer and the vendor certain brand and manufacturing specifications. Because caterers and airlines purchase such volumes, it is essential that someone can track purchasing, receiving and the utilization of products for the production of airline meals.

The interaction of the players, the airlines, the caterers, the manufacturers/suppliers and the distributors is the key in providing quality food service to passengers on airline carriers. These four components of the industry must communicate and work in agreement to achieve excellence in their endeavors. More than any other industry, these constituents are interlinked. It is difficult to separate clearly the functions of these players as roles and responsibilities overlap. The overlap and the co-operation found in this industry are what make it so interesting. The Galley Planner and Invoice Reconciliation System should also make sure that the interaction of these players is maintained at a very good level.

7.0 Methodology
7.1 Fact Finding
To study any system, one needs to collect facts and all relevant information. The facts when expressed in quantitative form are termed as data. The success of any project is depended upon the accuracy of available data. Accurate information can be collected with help of certain methods/ techniques. These specific methods for finding information of the system are termed as fact finding techniques. Interview, Questionnaire, Record View and Observations are the different fact finding techniques used. 
1.	Interview 
This method is used to collect the information from groups or individuals. Analyst (Interviewer) selects the people who are related with the system for the interview. In this method the analyst sits face to face with the people and records their responses. The interviewer must plan in advance the type of questions he/ she is going to ask and should be ready to answer any type of question. He should also choose a suitable place and time which will be comfortable for the respondent. 
2.	Questionnaire 
It is the technique used to extract information from number of people. The Questionnaire consists of series of questions framed together in logical manner. The questions are simple, clear and to the point. This method is very useful for attaining information from people who are concerned with the usage of the system and who are living in different countries. The questionnaire can be mailed or send to people by post. This is the cheapest source of fact finding. 
3.	Record View 
The information related to the system is published in the sources like newspapers, magazines, journals, documents etc. This record review helps the analyst to get valuable information about the system and the organization. 
4.	Observation 
Unlike the other fact finding techniques, in this method the analyst himself visits the organization and observes and understand the flow of documents, working of the existing system, the users of the system etc. For this method to be adopted it takes an analyst to perform this job as he knows which points should be noticed and highlighted.
7.2 Analysis
The system is required to have features such as:
•	Delivers a complete solution that spans all aspects of service planning, meal ordering, forecasting, operations, materials management, financial controls and analysis.
•	Facilitates using service partners or caterers that best meet your needs at each location, without being constrained to using proprietary systems.
•	Uses the industry’s most sophisticated, self-learning, meal-forecasting algorithm, reducing the over-boarding of passenger sensitive items.
•	Utilizes standard interfaces to flight schedules, reservations, departure control, operations, financial, ERP and other core operating systems.
•	Supports auditing of 100 percent of catering invoices incorporating airline specific rules and tolerances, reducing occurrences of overpayments.
7.3 Design
The design of the system will be through the use of data flow diagrams. These are essential in building a system of high level detail, showing how input data is transformed to output results through a sequence of functional transformations.
7.4 Development
In the development phase, the waterfall model will be employed where there will be separate and distinct phases of specification and development. These will include;
	Requirements analysis and definition
	System and software design
	Development and Coding
	Implementation and unit testing
	Integration and system testing
	Operation and maintenance
In this, one phase must be finished before proceeding to the next phase
Development Tools: 
•  Netbeans/Eclipse IDE
•  MySQL DBMS 
•  StarUML
•  Web server eg. Proxy
The objective of this stage is to transform the logical structure from the design stage to the actual system. The logical model of the way the existing system works has been derived by the analyst.
7.5 Deployment
This is the physical creation of the information system as defined in the system specification.
The steps taken include:
1.	Program testing
Program testing is done to ensure that the final software is free from error and can work appropriately under any condition without crushing. Invalid data is entered onto the system and the errors are monitored, checked and debugged.
2.	System is tested 
Users retest the developed system so that conclusion can be derived as to whether it is meeting the user’s requirements.
3.	Historic data from the old system is loaded into the new system
In this case all the important data is transferred from the existing system into the developed system so that no data is lost during change over period. Existing data may be found from the following:-
I.	Existing computer files or database.
•	In this case, conversion involves writing programs that accept data from the files or database and convert it in the format required by the new system.
II.	Existing manual file
•	It involves ensuring that the original record files are accurate, complete and updated
•	Recording data on specially designed input document.
•	Transcribing input document onto computer media.
